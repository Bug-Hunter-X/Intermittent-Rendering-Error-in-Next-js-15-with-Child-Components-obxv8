# Intermittent Rendering Error in Next.js 15 with Child Components

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where a child component sometimes fails to render within a parent component. The error is intermittent and doesn't occur consistently.

## Bug Description

A Next.js 15 application throws an error when a child component is rendered within a parent component. The error is not consistent and only occurs sometimes. The error message may vary but generally points towards an issue with the component's rendering process.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the application.  The error will occur intermittently; refreshing the page may or may not fix it.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the parent component's state is properly managed and doesn't lead to unexpected re-renders that might disrupt the child component rendering.  Using the `useMemo` hook helps prevent unnecessary re-renders. 

This bug might be related to issues with React's reconciliation process or specific interactions within Next.js 15.  Further investigation may be necessary to determine the root cause and a more comprehensive solution.
